says study 2 is a replication, but a) they didn't see if the same effect as study 1 replicates in the new data, and b) are only partially capable of doing so as they swapped out the anxiety measure for a different one (+ added a few other measures) + the outcome measure for accuracy changed between studies. so its a weak conceptual replication at best, which doesn't try to more directly replciate the original effect where it could.

the factors used in study 2 are derived from the data in an exploratory fashion and then used to test differences between them in a confirmatory fashion, without validating these superordinate factors. The concept and specifics of superordinate psychopathology factors are contentious, and this purely data driven approach may suffer conceptually or in terms of replicability. Risk of overfitting here.



“Together, these results reveal that the AD and CIT symptom dimensions exert equal and opposite effects on two key aspects of metacognition”

- assumes the symptom dimensions are a valid clustering, but they are data driven and not employed in other studies cited.
- "equal" and opposite? Analyses don't provide evidence for equality.

“In this article, we show that self-reported psychiatric symptoms are associated with specific shifts in confidence but not performance in a controlled perceptual decision-making task.” 

- no, they show how symptom CLUSTERS are assoicated with confidence.
- and they do not show evidence for the null in performance.
  - also "despite accuracy and parameters governing decision formation remaining unaffected" - no evidence for null

## overclaiming

"Taken together, our findings reveal that shifts in metacognitive evaluation represent a specific and pervasive behavioral correlate of subclinical psychopathology."

- specific to what? the factors are general



“Our findings indicate a specific and pervasive link between metacognition and mental health.” (Rouault et al., 2018, p. 443)

- only between TYPES of mental health and metacognition. 



"pervasive"

- no estimate of prevalence is made, this is all group level stats. this claim either doesnt meet the word's techncial meaning, or it is non techncial to the point of not being a clear claim.



“A relationship between lower confidence level and an AD symptom dimension is consistent with depression’s being characterized by pervasive negative shifts in self-evaluation (5,47,48).” (Rouault et al., 2018, p. 447)

- but AD is made up of anxiety too, which isn't characterised by this. this risks cherry picking evidence. if its specific to depression, show that.

# untested

Reliability of tasks?

# things not done

- apply study 1 analysis to study 2
- apply study 2's metacognitive efficiency metric in study 1 analyses
- do factor analysis on study 1's items to see if at least the DA factor is recovered
  - basically avoid overfitting
- reliability or validity of the accuracy, confidence or efficiency scores
  - eg alter get_full_perceptual_task_dat_exp_2.R to compute split half reliability for the different metrics
