stating that you apply an alpha correction method when it apparently has not been applied will decrease the severity of the test. While its substantive impact on the results are not large in this case, this does represent an error. - leaning towards correction.

some of the modelling choices are nerd shit

the disinterest in commenting on causality is puzzling - thoughts from others

1100 participants - selection effects? not strictly speaking an error, but doesn't mention somethign that might influence results. highlight in recommendation, dont' ask for correction

do some signalling that we hear Joop's take, causality isn't a dirty word, etc. Future research may wish to explicate their causal assumptions.
