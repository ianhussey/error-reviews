# Estimating the Reliability & Robustness Of Research (ERROR): A Bug Bounty Program for Science

ERROR is a comprehensive program to systematically detect and report errors in scientific publications, modelled after bug bounty programs in the technology industry. Investigators are paid for discovering errors in the scientific literature: The more severe the error, the larger the payout. In ERROR, we leverage, survey, document, and increase accessibility to error detection tools. Our goal is to foster a culture that is open to the possibility of error in science to embrace a new discourse norm of constructive criticism. 

See [error.reviews](https://error.reviews) for more details of the project, our team, and FAQs.
